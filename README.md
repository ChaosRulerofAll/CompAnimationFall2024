I was tasked with making an animation.
The assignment was to do it in unity, and I was given assets for it, but I wanted to do it in Godot.
Consequently all the assets are made in Godot, and the animation is also made in Godot, by hand by me.

I was also told to do an analysis for this assignment.
It is a door that starts by opening slowly, the slow opening adds suspence to the animation.
The door then is slammed shut, there is some exagation to the size of the door when it slams to add some weight to the hit.
